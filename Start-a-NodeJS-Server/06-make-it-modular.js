 *  ## MAKE IT MODULAR (Exercise 6 of 13)                                     *
 *                                                                            *
 * This problem is the same as the previous but introduces the concept of     *
 * modules. You will need to create two files to solve this.                  *
 *                                                                            *
 * Create a program that prints a list of files in a given directory,         *
 * filtered by the extension of the files. The first argument is the          *
 * directory name and the second argument is the extension filter. Print the  *
 * list of files (one file per line) to the console. You must use             *
 * asynchronous I/O.                                                          *
 *                                                                            *
 * You must write a module file to do most of the work. The module must       *
 * export a single function that takes three arguments: the directory name,   *
 * the filename extension string and a callback function, in that order. The  *
 * filename extension argument must be the same as what was passed to your    *
 * program. Don't turn it into a RegExp or prefix with "." or do anything     *
 * except pass it to your module where you can do what you need to make your  *
 * filter work.                                                               *
 *                                                                            *
 * The callback function must be called using the idiomatic node(err, data)   *
 * convention. This convention stipulates that unless there's an error, the   *
 * first argument passed to the callback will be null, and the second will be *
 * your data. In this exercise, the data will be your filtered list of files, *
 * as an Array. If you receive an error, e.g. from your call to               *
 * fs.readdir(), the callback must be called with the error, and only the     *
 * error, as the first argument.                                              *
 *                                                                            *
 * You must not print directly to the console from your module file, only     *
 * from your original program.                                                *
 *                                                                            *
 * In the case of an error bubbling up to your original program file, simply  *
 * check for it and print an informative message to the console.              *
 *                                                                            *
 * These four things are the contract that your module must follow.           *
 *                                                                            *
 * » Export a single function that takes exactly the arguments described.     *
 * » Call the callback exactly once with an error or some data as described.  *
 * » Don't change anything else, like global variables or stdout.             *
 * » Handle all the errors that may occur and pass them to the callback.      *
 *                                                                            *
 * The benefit of having a contract is that your module can be used by anyone *
 * who expects this contract. So your module could be used by anyone else who *
 * does learnyounode, or the verifier, and just work.                         *

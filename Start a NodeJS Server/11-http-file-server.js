*  ## HTTP FILE SERVER (Exercise 11 of 13)                                   *
*                                                                            *
*  Write an HTTP server that serves the same text file for each request it   *
*  receives.                                                                 *
*                                                                            *
*  Your server should listen on the port provided by the first argument to   *
*  your program.                                                             *
*                                                                            *
*  You will be provided with the location of the file to serve as the second *
*  command-line argument. You must use the fs.createReadStream() method to   *
*  stream the file contents to the response.                                 *
